I drove my Porsche to the Biergarten a few towns over, but when I got there they were all out of beer!
The hund hoped into the BMW and played Rammstein while riding down to the Flughafen.
Once I got to Flughafen I topped at the local Baeckerei and bought us both a Apfelkuchen.
While my hund and I ate our apfelkuchen, I decided to stop and grab some brawurst and a loaf of Brut at the local grocer.
As I was checking out, the Klimaanlage broke and I felt bad for the employee in the thick Leaderhose. 
I felt so bad for him i decided to give him plane tickets to Berlin and a voucher to visit Eltz.
My Klimaanlage was not working so I had to stand outside the Eltz in the heat while waiting for a taxi!
The taxi took me and my hund to the Wettbewerbsfaehig talent show in town so I could listen to some music.
But the venue didn't allow hunds, so we decided to try the baeckerei instead.
